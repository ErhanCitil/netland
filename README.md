# Netland
Netland is a website where you can see a table of information about series and movies. This data could you update and delete. I have worked with a MySQL database, the default database that Django uses is Sqlite. You can change your login details of your localhost phpmyadmin in settings.py.

# Getting Started
With the following instructions you can get the project working on your local machine.

# Prerequisites
`Python 3.10.5 and Django==4.1 or an higher version`

# Installing
First of all you need to clone this repository to your local machine. After that you can paste the sql query's that I put in the sql folder in your localhost/phpmyadmin. 

## Activating the environment & Installing the requirements
Open any terminal in your main folder and activate the environment doing: `. env/Scripts/activate` for windows and `source env/bin/activate` for IOS. Install all the requirements from requirements.txt with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Change your login credintials in the settings.py file. 

## Running the server
Run the server from your terminal with the command `python manage.py runserver`.
